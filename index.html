<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b><br>
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of Stylesheets.</p><br><hr><br>
    
<p><b>Note</b><br>
To carry out the html examples in this tutorial, you will need a text-editor. On Windows, Notepad++ is a very good one to use. On Mac, Sublime Text is excellent. <br>
Also, an up-to-date browser is advised. <br>
The examples are there for you to practice with as you go along. Simply write them out save your document (with the .html extension) and run in your browser. When you add others, just save again and reload the browser.
